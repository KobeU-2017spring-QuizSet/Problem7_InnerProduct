# Introduction

In this excersise, we will write a code to culculate inner product. If you have vectors, $A = (a_0, a_1,...,a_n )$ and $B=(a_0, a_1,...,a_n)$, a inner product of $A$ and $B$ is $A \cdot B = \sum^n_{i=0}a_ib_i$.


# Question

- write a function to culculate a inner product of one dimention vectors $A$ and $B$
- in this excersise, let `A <- c(6,4,6,8,9,1)` and `B <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)`
 
# Sample Answer


```{r}

  InnerProduct_of <- function(A,B){
        N <- length(A)
        if(N != length(B)){
          return('error: two vectors do not have the same length')
        }
        S <- 0
        for (i in 1:N){
          S = S + A[i]*B[i]
        }
        return(S)
    }

  A <- c(6,4,6,8,9,1)
  B <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
  InnerProduct_of(A,B)
 
```
